# icm_add_shared_lib
#
# icm_add_shared_lib(mylib MYLIB mylib_a.cpp mylib_b.cpp)
# Adds a shared library, forces visibility hidden, and adds definitons
# Args:
#   * target - name of the target (the lib we're adding)
#   * cname  - a name to be used when for the definitons added must be a valid
#              C/C++ symbol name
#   * ...    - optional sources
# Definitions added to target when cname is "MYLIB":
#   * BUILDING_MYLIB=1
#   * MYLIB_SHARED=1
# Thus for the library you can use a main include file like this:
#
# // mylib_api.h
# #if MYLIB_SHARED
# #   if BUILDING_MYLIB
# #       define MYLIB_API SYMBOL_EXPORT
# #   else
# #       define MYLIB_API SYMBOL_IMPORT
# #   endif
# #else
# #   define MYLIB_API
# #endif

#     By default on Apple platforms the default suffix by CMake for modules is
#     `so`. This doesn't play well with many loaders which require .dylib files.
