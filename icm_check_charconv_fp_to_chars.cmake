#
# 1.0.0 (2024-04-11) Initial release
#
#           DOCUMENTATION
#
# Check whether charconv has floating-point to_chars. Sadly in in 2024 this is
# still not implemented in many popular and supported compilers. :(
#
# To use simply include this file. After that haveCharconvFpToChars will be set
# to a truthy or a falsy value.
#
#           NOTES
#
# This file is bundled with icm_check_charconv_fp_to_chars.cpp and expects it
# to be in its directory.
